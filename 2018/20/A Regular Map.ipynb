    "I can't think of a way of generating the paths from the regex directly, so run through each possibility, drawing the map, and then do a breadth first search until the last room is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do this a character at a time. The map is represented as a graph, with rooms as nodes. Maintain a set of processing nodes, the possible rooms reached at the current character. Branches are tracked with a stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the next character is a direction that direction is applied to the processing nodes and the joining edges are added to the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the next character is an opening bracket then the path branches so add the processing nodes to the stack as the root of the branches, together with an empty set which will become the set of all leaves of the branch, all possible final rooms in the branches' paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue going through the rooms until the branch ends, either with a bar `|` or a closing bracket. The set of processing nodes is then added to the set of the branches' leaves. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the current character is a bar the branches's root becomes the processing nodes again and  then continues working through the new branch's directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise there's a closing bracket and these branches are dealt with. The top of the stack is removed and the processing nodes are set to the leaves of the branches. "
